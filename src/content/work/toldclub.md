## The company

Told builds SDKs to create user survey campaigns for Android and iOS applications and websites. It is ready to be used to manage campaigns for Royal Canin, Wingly, Bricks.co and many others, targeting tens of thousands of users. It has many uses, from evaluating payment tunnels, to CSAT, CES, requesting or validating new features and much more!

## My role

I audited Android SDK code, ensuring stability, fixing crashes, and enhancing performance through Kotlin best practices and clean architecture adoption. I drafted comprehensive audit reports with corrective actions and upgrade suggestions.


## My tasks

* Correct potential crashes 
* Implement the best development practices on Android in Kotlin to facilitate debugging and the evolution of the product by moving to clean architecture.
* Improve SDK performance, in particular by managing coroutines.
* Drafting the audit report, including the problems encountered, the corrections made and advice on maintaining and upgrading the SDK.
